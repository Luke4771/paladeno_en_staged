1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files.
2. Before you make any major changes, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
3. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
4. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
5. Maintain a documentation file that describes how the architecture of the app works inside and out.
6. Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file, you MUST read the file before answering. Make sure to investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. 
7. Never make any claims about code before investigating unless you are certain of the correct answer - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.
8. In Plan mode: Before you plan, ask me clarifying questions about anything ambiguous.
9. Never use em dashes (—) in any text or code. Use commas, periods, or other punctuation instead. Em dashes are a tell for AI-generated text.
10. Read the architecture.md.
11. More detailed, component-specific documentation is located and maintained in the `docs/context` folder. Coding agents should read the relevant file there before making changes to any component.
12. Planning documentation is located in `docs/planning`.
13. If there is critical information about the project that needs to be remembered, store that information in memory.md
